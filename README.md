# JPMC Task 1
Starter repo for task 1 of the JPMC software engineering program
Important Notes
The program's functionality heavily relies on the proper functioning of the server API. If the server is not operational or the API is inaccessible, the program may not function as expected.
Make sure that the server API URL specified in the client3.py file is accessible from your network.
The program is a demonstration of data analysis and may not be suitable for production-level usage without appropriate modifications and error handling.
